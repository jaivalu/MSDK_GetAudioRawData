# Meeting SDK for Windows - Get Audio Raw Data

A Windows C++ Application demonstrate Zoom Meeting SDK receiving audio raw data from a Zoom Meeting.

# Install vcpkg for adding dependency libs.
You might need to use Powershell (as administrator) or Windows Terminal to execute the sh script files
```
cd ~
cd source
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg integrate install --vcpkg-root c:\vcpkg
```

# Add dependency libs


```
./vcpkg install jsoncpp
```


## Add a configuration file named `config.json`

```
{
  "sdk_jwt": "<your_sdk_jwt>",
  "meeting_number": <meeting_number_to_join>,
  "passcode": "<passcode>",
  "video_source": "Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_1MB.mp4",
  "zak":""
}
```

The app will try to join the meeting follow the Meeting Number you specified in the config.json. 

## Add the sdk files into a folder name `SDK`


## Open and Run Project

Open "MSDK_GetAudioRawData.vcxproj" file from Visual Studio 2022.

Hit F5 or click from menu "Debug" -> "Start Debugging" in x86 or x64 to launch the application.


## Error

if you are getting an error about not being able to open source json/json.h , include this in your

Visual Studio Project -> Properties. Under C/C++ ->General ->Additional Include Directories,

 ### x64
 C:\yourpath\whereyouinstalled\vcpkg\packages\jsoncpp_x64-windows\include
 
 or

 ### x86
 C:\yourpath\whereyouinstalled\vcpkg\packages\jsoncpp_x86-windows\include

  # Error

  what if i would like to use x64 environment?

  add this to your environment variable before installing openCV from vcpkg

  VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET = x64-windows

  you can use `setx VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET "x64-windows"` to set it via command line

  and reinstall by using the command below

  ```
  ./vcpkg install jsoncpp
  ```

## Getting Started

The main method, or main entry point of this application is at `MSDK_GetAudioRawData.cpp`

From a high level point of view it will do the below

- Join a meeting
- Wait for callback or status update. There are some prerequistes before you can get audio raw data. The `CanIStartRecording()` method helps to check if you have fulfilled these requirements
  - You need to have host, co-host or recording permissions
  - You need to be in-meeting. This is the status when you have fully joined a meeting.
- Get the Meeting Recording Controller
  - Use the Meeting Recording Controller to call `StartRawRecording()`. Do note that you can only either run `StartRecording()` or `StartRawRecording()`. You cannot run them both at once.
- Thereafter, you should be able to `GetAudioRawdataHelper()`, which is used to subscribe to your `ZoomSDKAudioRawDataDelegate.cpp` (An implementation of `IZoomSDKAudioRawDataDelegate`). If you encounter error calling `GetAudioRawdataHelper(), you might be calling it without the prequisites. 
  - In the implementation(`ZoomSDKAudioRawDataDelegate.cpp`), `onMixedAudioRawDataReceived` and `onOneWayAudioRawDataReceived` will start to receive callbacks.
  - I'm using `onMixedAudioRawDataReceived` to save the PCM buffer into a file. You will need to use a converter such as ffmpeg to convert this PCM file into a playable wav or mp3 file.

# Upgrading Guide

You will need to download the latest Meeting SDK Windows for c++ from marketplace.zoom.us

Replace the files in the folder `SDK` with those found in the downloaded files from marketplace.zoom.us

You will need to ensure any missing abstract classes are implemented etc... before you can compile and upgrade to a newer SDK version.

Some classes might need additional libraries, depending on your development environment, example...

`meeting_participants_ctrl_interface.h` might need `#include "meeting_service_components/meeting_audio_interface.h"`
`rawdata_renderer_interface.h` might need `#include <cstdint>`

You might encounter these errors

Error	C3646	'GetAudioJoinType': unknown override specifier	
Error (active)	E0020	identifier "AudioType" is undefined	SkeletonDemo
`meeting_participants_ctrl_interface.h` might need `#include "meeting_service_components/meeting_audio_interface.h"`

Rebuild and Run, it should resolve both errors above

Error	C2061	syntax error: identifier 'uint32_t'
`rawdata_audio_helper_interface.h` might need `#include <cstdint>`

# Resolving Errors

What are the specs of the returned PCM audio?
Mono, 16 bits and 32000khz.

Does both onMixedAudioRawDataReceived and onOneWayAudioRawDataReceived run at the same time?

Yes. You use onOneWayAudioRawDataReceived to get a specific person's audio stream. You use onMixedAudioRawDataReceived to get the entire party's audio stream.

What are some libraries I need to include in the main class? 
you will need to `#include <meeting_recording_interface.h>`

#adding curl, needed for webservice.cpp and webservice.h

./vcpkg install curl

add c++, general, addition include directories "C:\Users\$(UserName)\source\vcpkg\packages\curl_x64-windows\include" 

#SDK_ERR_NOT_JOIN_AUDIO

you will need to ensure when joining a meeting this is set to false 
	joinMeetingWithoutLoginParam.isAudioOff = false;

here's an additional parameter to enable auto joining of audio
	//set join audio to true
	ZOOM_SDK_NAMESPACE::IAudioSettingContext* pAudioContext = settingService->GetAudioSettings();
	if (pAudioContext)
	{
		
		pAudioContext->EnableAutoJoinAudio(true);
	}
